Please create a folder in this base directory called PR_data. Make this folder identical to the PR_data folder provided for the coursework on BlackBoard. That is to say, it should include the file cuhk03_new_protocol_config_labeled.mat and the file feature_data.json .

Each notebook demonstrates a certain model in action. Wherever there is an adjustable hyper-parameter in the code, it is denoted by a snippet of text in Markdown explaining what the hyper-parameter is.
